# Connor's website

Professional Website. I used Dr. Maria Tackett's [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYf5HqU1pI4) presented at R Ladies Baltimore to create this site. I received help and template modifications from Claire Cusack and [their website](https://cecusack.github.io/ClaireCusack/).

Packages used include `{blogdown}`, `{distill}`, and `{postcards}`.
